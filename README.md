# Mozzi journey

Mozzi (https://sensorium.github.io/Mozzi/) is a powerfull library to create and generate sounds from your arduino.

I'm exploring its API and I'm trying to understand how it work, how to use it (and how to use an arduino).

My initial plan is to build a mini sequencer (as simple as it can be) with 3 tracks : 
The first one for noise generated drums and two osiclators with filters, effects, vibrato etc...

Two buttons, two potentiometers, four LEDs, one speaker (or jack output)
