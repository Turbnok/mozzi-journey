## Disclaimer
I'm not a c++ developer nor a arduino expert and even less a sound expert. I try -with my developer experience- to mimic some classic development technics in order to build simple things. If I say some bs, feel free to make a PR to correct me ! 
## What I've learned

### Octave and notes
Notes (Do, RÃ©, Mi, Fa, Sol, La, Si) or (C,D,E,F,G,A,B) have frequencies. Everybody (at least me) have already heard of "A 440Hz".
The "440 A" refers to a particular octave on the piano : 4. On a regular 88 keys piano you have 7 full octaves. The "440 A" is on the 4th full octave : A4.
If you want the same note on a different octave, you just have to multiply (or divide) its frequency by 2 : that's all.
